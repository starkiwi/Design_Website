		<p class="sub">Choosing colors is an important part of the web design
			process that
			can make or break the final result. In this guide, we'll review
			color theory and psychology fundamentals and lay out a step-by-step
			process for creating color palettes for websites.</p>

		<hr>

		<p>If you're a web designer who struggles to create color schemes for
			websites, you're not alone. Choosing colors may seem intuitive, but
			in fact there's a lot of strategy that goes into creating effective
			color palettes. Everyone has subjective opinions on different
			colors--some people love bold, bright colors like cherry red and
			neon green, whereas others gravitate towards soft pastels.
		</p>
		<aside
				class="pull_quote"><p>The
			challenge for web designers is to look past their subjective views,
			and those of their clients.
		</p></aside>
		<p>
			Fortunately, there are certain principles and methods that help make
			color choice a breeze for web designers. In this guide, we'll teach
			you how to take the guesswork out of choosing colors for your web
			design projects. First, we'll review the fundamental color theory
			and psychology principles every designer needs to know. Then, we'll
			spell out a simple 3-step process that’ll help you choose colors for
			websites like a pro.

		<hr>

		<div class="left">
			<h2>Why choosing the right colors is important</h2>
			<p>You may be wondering: is color choice really that important for a
				website? The answer is a resounding yes. Good color choice
				promotes
				<b>legibility</b>, <b>visual appeal</b>, and <b>brand
					recognition</b>. Bad color
				choice,
				on the other hand, creates a poor user experience. As we all
				know, a
				poor user experience spells disaster for a business website.</p>
			<h3>Legibility</h3>
			<img src="images/color_images_importance.png"
				 alt="Graphic demonstrating legibility, color schemes, and brand recognition">
			<p>Color choice helps determine whether the content on a page is
				readable. Legibility is optimized with an appropriate level of
				color
				contrast between the text and the background. Too little
				contrast
				makes the text hard to read; too much contrast is hard on the
				eyes.
				A classic example of color contrast is black text on a white
				background. If you look closely, you'll notice that many
				websites
				actually use dark grey text on a white or off-white background
				in
				order to maximize legibility while minimizing eye strain.</p>
			<h3>Visual Appeal</h3>
			<p>When referring to visual appeal in web design, we're not talking
				about subjective color opinions. Instead, the emphasis is on
				creating harmonious color palettes that are easy on the eyes.
				Choosing colors that have broad visual appeal requires an
				understanding of color theory. As we'll discuss in more detail
				later
				on, there are three types of color schemes that have universal
				appeal: monochromatic, complementary, and analogous. Recognizing
				and
				knowing how to create these color schemes makes choosing colors
				for
				websites easier and more effective.
			</p>
			<h3>Brand Recognition</h3>
			<p>Another important role of colors in a web design context is brand
				recognition. Many brands have a primary color (or two) that has
				a
				strong presence across their website, marketing materials, and
				other
				brand assets. Some classic examples that come to mind are
				Coca-Cola's red, the Starbucks green, and Ikea's high-contrast
				blue
				and yellow. Consistency is key for creating brand recognition
				through color. Later on, we'll see how color psychology comes
				into
				play when choosing primary brand colors.</p>

		<h2>Using color theory to choose colors</h2>
		<p>Color theory is a practical framework for determining which colors
			work well together. The principles of color theory revolve around
			the color wheel, which visually portrays the relationships between
			different colors. The color wheel contains primary, secondary, and
			tertiary colors. It can also be divided into warm and cool colors.
			Familiarizing yourself with the color wheel is the first step to
			learning how to choose harmonious colors.</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>Color schemes</h2>
		<p>A color scheme is a harmonious combination of colors. The three main
			types of color schemes designers should know about are
			<b>monochromatic</b>, <b>complementary</b>, and <b>analogous</b>.
			You
			could
			think of
			these schemes as sort of like templates for choosing colors. Let's
			look at each one in more detail.</p>
		<div class="right">
			<img src="images/color_schemes.png"
				 alt="colour wheels with monochromatic, complementary, and analogous colour schemes">
			<h3>Monochromatic</h3>
			<p>Monochromatic color schemes are based on a single hue ("mono"
				means
				one). Hues are primary and secondary colors, like red, yellow,
				and
				green. To create a monochromatic color scheme, you'd pick a hue,
				for
				instance blue, and use tints, shades, and tones to create a
				harmonious palette. Monochromatic colors tick the box for visual
				appeal, but be careful to create enough contrast for
				legibility.</p>
			<h3>Complementary</h3>
			<p>Complementary color schemes consist of colors on opposite ends of
				the
				color wheel. For example, red and green or blue and orange.
				Complementary colors tend to contrast well and are therefore a
				popular choice for web design. However, the contrast can be
				striking
				and should therefore be used intentionally in order to ensure
				that
				the colors aren't too distracting.
			</p>
			<h3>Analogous</h3>
			<p>Analogous color schemes are made of colors that sit next to each
				other on the color wheel. These color schemes are inherently
				visually appealing, but as with monochromatic color schemes, be
				careful to create enough contrast for legibility. A tip for
				using an
				analogous color scheme on a website is to pair it with a neutral
				color like black or white in order to improve readability.

		<p>
			Once you have a good handle on color theory, creating harmonious
			color palettes becomes more intuitive. But which scheme is best for
			a given project, and how do you decide which sections of the color
			wheel to use? This is where color psychology comes into play.</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>Using Color Psychology To Choose Colors</h2>
		<p>Whereas color theory is centered on creating harmonious color
			schemes, color psychology is concerned with the feelings and
			emotions different colors evoke. Feelings and emotions may sound
			wishy-washy in a business context, but they actually play a critical
			role in branding, marketing, and sales. In fact, emotions are at the
			core of a consumer's decision making process <a
					href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/inside-the-consumer-mind/201302/how-emotions-influence-what-we-buy#:~:text=The%20emotional%20core%20of%20consumer%20decision%2Dmaking&text=Most%20people%20believe%20that%20the,cases%2C%20even%20determine%20our%20decisions.&text=These%20emotions%20create%20preferences%2C%20which%20lead%20to%20our%20decision."
					target="_blank">(source)</a>.
		</p>
		<h3>Color Meanings</h3>
		<p>One way to incorporate color psychology when choosing colors for a
			website is through consideration of common color meanings. Different
			colors, both consciously and subconsciously, spark certain feelings.
			These feelings are largely influenced by cultural contexts, as well
			as personal experiences. Below are some examples of common color
			associations:</p>
		<div class="left">
			<img src="images/rainbow.jpg" alt="rainbow" height="450">
			<ul>
				<li><b id="red">Red:</b> passion, power, love, danger,
					excitement</li>
				<li><b id="blue">Blue:</b> calm, trust, competence, peace,
					logic,
					readability
				</li>
				<li><b id="green">Green:</b> health, nature, abundance,
					prosperity</li>
				<li><b id="yellow">Yellow:</b> happiness, optimism, creativity,
					friendliness
				</li>
				<li><b id="orange">Orange:</b> fun, freedom, warmth, comfort,
					playfulness
				</li>
				<li><b id="purple">Purple:</b> luxury, mystery, sophistication,
					loyalty,
					creativity
				</li>
				<li><b id="pink">Pink:</b> nurturing, gentleness, sincerity,
					warmth</li>
				<li><b id="brown">Brown:</b> nature, security, protection,
					support</li>
				<li><b id="black">Black:</b> elegance, power, control,
					sophistication,
					depression
				</li>
				<li><b id="white">White:</b> purity, peace, clarity,
					cleanliness</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some color meanings appear contradictory. For instance, red often
				denotes danger, but it can also convey love and passion. Black
				can
				evoke feelings of power in some cases and depression in others.
				The
				key here is <b>context.</b>
				<br>
				Context is crucial to consider when choosing colors for a brand
				or
				website. Using the color red for a website won't automatically
				signal danger, just like it won't automatically signal romance.
				The
				other elements on the page, such as typography, imagery, and
				messaging, all work symbiotically to convey a certain look and
				feel.
				<br>
				Color psychology can help inform which colors would best
				represent
				your client's brand. It makes sense to use green for a
				health-centered website because of the color's associations with
				health, nature, and abundance.
			</p>
			<aside class="pull_quote"><p>However, in creative fields like
				design, rules are sometimes meant to be broken.
			</p></aside>
			<p>Within the
				right
				context, an unexpected color scheme could work favorably for a
				brand. A health brand with a red color scheme would certainly
				stand
				out among its green competitors; the trick is to make it stand
				out
				in a good way, a skill that takes time and practice to master.

		<h2>How To Create A Color Palette For A Website</h2>
		<p>Now that we've reviewed the fundamentals of color theory and
			psychology, we're ready to put what we've learned into practice in
			order to create strategic color palettes for websites. Aesthetics
			are certainly important in the web design world; but a pretty color
			palette that's thrown together without intention or strategy won't
			serve anyone.
			<br>
			Here's a simple, 3-step process for choosing colors for a website
			like a pro.
		</p>
		<div class="right">
			<img src="images/color_603010.png"
				 alt="the 60/30/10 color breakdown for this website">
			<h3>1. Choose a primary color</h3>
			<p>The best place to start when creating a color palette is with the
				primary color. A palette's primary color is the star of the
				show. If
				we follow the <b>60/30/10 rule</b>, the primary color takes up
				about
				60% of
				the color on a website.
				<br>
				When choosing a strong primary color, it's helpful to consider
				two
				things: <b>color psychology</b> and <b>context</b>. Reference
				the
				color meanings
				listed above to determine which color best conveys the emotions
				that
				users should feel when they land on the website. Should they
				feel
				calm or excited? Free or secure? Curious or protected? Don't
				forget
				to consider context; relying too heavily on common color
				associations can be detrimental out of context.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>P.S. Check out <a
						href="https://www.flux-academy.com/blog/how-to-strategically-use-color-in-website-design"
						target="_blank">this post</a> to learn more about the
					60/30/10 rule
					and
					other tips for choosing colors strategically.</i></p>
			<h3>2. Choosing secondary colors</h3>
			<p>Once you've chosen a primary color, select one or more secondary
				colors. According to the 60/30/10 rule, secondary colors take up
				about 30% of a website. In order to choose secondary colors,
				you'll
				need to first determine which type of color scheme is best for
				the
				website: monochromatic, complementary, or analogous.
				<br>
				Color psychology can play a role here as well. Soft, muted
				colors
				convey a totally different look and feel from bright, vivid
				colors.
				A monochromatic blue color scheme might appear calming and
				soothing;
				but a complementary blue and orange color scheme could look
				playful
				and exciting.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Pro tip: Use an interactive color wheel tool like
					Adobe's or Canva's
					to play around with different color schemes.</i>

			</p>
			<h3>3. Choose an accent color</h3>
			<p>Last but not least, every color palette should include an accent
				color. This color is used sparingly, taking up about 10% of real
				estate on a website. Often, the accent color contrasts strongly
				against the primary color. This contrast helps the accent color
				stand out and draw attention to important elements on the page,
				for
				instance buttons.
				<br>
				The term "accent color" typically calls to mind vibrant colors
				like
				teal or orange. But note that black and white are considered
				colors
				as well and can be used effectively as accent colors, especially
				on
				more colorful websites.</p>

		<h2>Learn the art and strategy of high-value websites</h2>
		<p>In this guide, we reviewed color theory and psychology fundamentals
			and laid out a 3-step process for creating strategic color palettes
			for websites. Once you've mastered the process of choosing colors,
			you're well on your way to creating high-value websites for clients.
			But what other skills are needed in order to improve your web design
			process so that you can provide more value to your clients, and in
			turn, charge more for your work?
		</p>
		<aside class="pull_quote"><p>
			Color is just one of several visual design principles every web
			designer should master.</p></aside>
		<p>Other important principles include
			typography, layout, and UX. And in order to put these principles to
			work, it's essential to master the strategy behind web design.
			Conducting strategy sessions with your clients will help you uncover
			what problems they're facing and what goals they're trying to reach;
			the secret to high-value web design is setting measurable objectives
			upfront and solving real problems.
		</p>

		<p>
			In sum, creating high-value websites is a combination of art and
			strategy. Our web design course, <b>The $10k Website Process</b>,
			teaches
			just that. This comprehensive course teaches Ran Segall's
			tried-and-true process for creating standout websites that create
			real results for clients. The course will give you the tools and
			confidence you need to book your dream clients and charge more for
			your work.

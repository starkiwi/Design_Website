		<h1>11 Principles of Design

		<p class="sub">Learn 11 core principles of design and how to apply them
			to
			your
			graphic design work. Check out visual examples of essential design
			principles.</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>The <b>11</b> principles of design every graphic designer should be
			familiar with:</h2>

		<p>There’s much debate over exactly how many principles of design exist.
			Some designers say 7, others 12, and still others somewhere in
			between. But when it comes to design principles, numbers aren’t the
			important thing.
			<br>
			Principles of design give designers a set of guidelines for how to
			design visually appealing compositions that create wonderful user
			experiences.
			</p>

		<div class="left">
			<h3>1. Hierarchy</h3>
			<img src="images/principles_images_1.png"
				 alt="examples of principles 1-5">
			<p><b>Visual hierarchy</b> is a vital part of good design. If
					   everything on
				your page looks like it has the same importance, then nothing
				appears important. </p>
			<aside class="pull_quote"><p>You need to use <b>visual cues</b> to
				tell
				people
				what
				to pay attention to first, second, third, etc.</p></aside>
			<p>
				Create visual hierarchy through things like scale (the relative
				size
				of elements) and color. Typographic hierarchy can be created by
				using different typefaces, sizes, and font weights.
				<br>
				The point is to make sure the most important element on the page
				stands out among the rest.</p>
			<h3>2. Balance</h3>
			<p><b>Balance</b> within a composition can be achieved in a
					couple of
				different
				ways. Symmetrical balance is the most straightforward. It’s
				achieved
				when elements on either side of a central vertical axis are
				basically the same. For example, two text blocks on either side
				of
				the page would create symmetrical balance, even if the content
				of
				those blocks wasn’t identical.
				<br>
				<b><a
						href="https://dribbble.com/stories/2020/02/05/asymmetrical-layouts-ui-design"
						target="_blank">Asymmetrical balance</a></b> is achieved
				when the
				elements on either
				side of
				a central axis aren’t the same. Like in the example webpage,
				you
				might have a
				large
				image on one side balanced out by prominent text on the other.
				It
				can also be achieved when the vertical axis that divides two
				elements isn’t placed directly in the center of the page. In
				that
				case, the narrower element should have a “heavier” visual weight
				than the wider one to achieve a balanced look.
				<br>
				Whichever type of balance technique you use, the result should
				feel
				right. It should give the viewer a sense of harmony and not make
				them feel uneasy.</p>
			<h3>3. Alignment</h3>
			<p><b>Alignment</b> refers to how text or graphic elements are
				lined up on
				a
				page. This can refer to their alignment in relation to the
				entire
				composition (left, center, or right-aligned) as well as their
				alignment to one another.
				<br>
				When elements aren’t aligned properly, especially in relation to
				one
				another, it adds a sense of chaos to the composition. It looks
				haphazard and messy.
				<br>
				When it comes to this principle of design, be sure to align
				elements
				properly in relation to one another, and be consistent with the
				alignment of various elements, such as always centering
				headlines.
			</p>
			<h3>4. Emphasis</h3>
			<p><b>Emphasis</b> is the part of a design that catches the eye of
					the
				user—a
				focal point, in other words. Ideally, this should be the most
				important part of the design, whether that’s the headline, an
				image,
				or a CTA. But that doesn’t always happen.
				<br>
				Inexperienced designers may inadvertently emphasize the wrong
				parts
				of the page, creating confusion on the part of the user.
				<br>
				Be sure to emphasize the parts you want your users to look at
				first.
				You can do this through things like scale, white space, color,
				shadow, pattern, or other techniques.</p>
			<h3>5. Proportion</h3>
			<p><b>Proportion</b>, also referred to as <b>scale</b>, is the
				relative
				size of
				objects within a design. Elements that are larger in relation to
				others will stand out more and appear to have more importance to
				users. Smaller elements appear less important.
			</p>
			<aside class="pull_quote"><p>
				Use proportion to create visual interest by drawing the viewer’s
				eye
				to particular visual elements within your designs.
			</p></aside>
			<p>
				Just keep in mind that too much of a difference in the scale of
				items can make the smallest items get lost entirely, or make the
				largest ones appear comically large.

			</p>

			<h3>6. Movement</h3>
			<p><b>Movement</b> refers to the way a user’s eyes move across your
				composition. Dynamic designs encourage lots of eye movement,
				while
				static ones encourage less. The best designers can, to an
				extent,
				control which elements users focus on by placing them along the
				path
				of the most natural eye movement patterns.
				<br>
				It’s important to familiarize yourself with the most common eye
				movement patterns, <b>F- and Z-patterns</b>, and the <b><a
						href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/layer-cake-pattern-scanning/"
						target="_blank">layer cake
					pattern</a></b>. F-
				and Z-patterns are more common on image-heavy pages, while the
				layer
				cake pattern is facilitated by lots of text with headings and
				subheadings.
			</p>
			<h3>7. Negative Space</h3>
			<p><b>Negative space</b> in a design, also called white space, is
				space
				that
				has no design elements (other than possibly a background color
				or
				subtle pattern or texture).
				<br>
				As a design principle, negative space is essential because it
				gives
				the elements in your composition room to breathe. Without white
				space, pages look cluttered and are hard to navigate.
				<br>
				Be sure to leave some space around elements on your pages,
				especially the most important ones. This white space makes them
				stand out more and facilitates a better user experience.

						target="_blank">3 ways to use negative space in logo
					design</a></i></p>
			<h3>8. Contrast</h3>
			<p><b>Contrast</b> can be achieved through color, shape, size, or
				similar
				properties of elements, and refers to the differences between
				them.
				Color contrast is often the first thing people think of, but
				differences in the sizes of elements, their shape, or some other
				property also create contrast.
				<br>
				Contrast serves two very important functions. First, it allows
				you
				to make elements stand out from one another. A complete lack of
				contrast would result in a design that’s simply a single
				background
				color with no other visible elements — not exactly a functional
				design. A design where you can see different elements
				automatically
				has some level of contrast.
				<br>
				The second important function of contrast is <b>accessibility
					</b>.
				Sufficient contrast between elements, especially text and its
				background, is vital for creating an accessible design. People
				with
				vision impairments can have a difficult time reading text on a
				screen that is too small or does not have sufficient color
				contrast.
				There are <b><a
						href="https://dribbble.com/stories/2019/08/30/5-accessibility-tools-to-check-your-design-s-contrast-ratio"
						target="_blank">accessibility tools</a></b> available
				for
				checking
				that your
				designs have sufficient color contrast for accessibility
				purposes.
			<h3>9. Repetition</h3>
			<p><b>Repetition</b> refers to using the same or similar elements
				throughout
				your design, either in regular or irregular patterns. It’s used
				to
				reinforce certain elements while also providing a sense of unity
				and
				continuity to your design. Repetition can be used to create
				<b>rhythm</b>,
				which helps move users through your designs.
				<br>
				Employ repetition in simple ways—such as using the same icons
				throughout, in background patterns, or through things like
				styling
				all of your photos in the same way.
				<br>
				Experiment with repetition, particular irregular repetition, to
				create movement, but beware that too much regular repetition can
				have the opposite effect and make your design feel static.
			</p>
			<h3>10. Variety</h3>
			<p>While
				repetition adds a sense of harmony to your design, <b>variety
				</b>
						keeps
				it
				interesting and prevents users from getting bored.
			</p>
			<aside class="pull_quote"><p><b>Variety is the spice of life,
				right?</b></p></aside>
			<p>
				The same is true for design. Create variety by adding unique or
				unexpected
				elements to your
				designs. Variety can be used to draw the user’s attention to
				specific elements or areas of the design, and make them stand
				out.
			</p>
			</div>
			<h3>11. Unity</h3>
			<p><b>Unity</b> gives a design and sense of harmony, both visually
					and
				conceptually. Unity is important because it makes users feel at
				ease
				while navigating your design. Everything appears to be in its
				proper
				place and there are no jarring elements that stand out in a
				negative
				way.
				<br>
				Unity can be created in a number of ways. The primary methods
				are
				through:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Proximity</b> — Elements close to one another appear to
					be a
					unified
					group
				</li>
				<li><b>Alignment</b> — Elements aligned with one another
					appear to be
					related
				</li>
				<li><b>Repetition</b> — Elements that are repeated also create a
					sense of
					unity, especially if that repetition is done in a regular
					pattern.
				</li>
			</ul>
